# Can-Bus
this is my repo where i explore CAN BUS and OBD2 stuff  






the code uses platformio and the arduino framework.  
im using a esp32 devboard. if youre using a differnt one please change the board in platformio.ini  

with platformio installed run:
``` bash
pio run -t upload
```
this will build and upload the project to your board

if youre wanting to edit code i recomend that you run:
``` bash
pio run -t compilebd
```
